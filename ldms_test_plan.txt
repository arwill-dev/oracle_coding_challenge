-- This gives an idea of how an actual manual test plan will look.
-- It aims to test that all the departments and employees have been created successfully.
-- It will also test one 'success' condition for each of the subprograms in the pkg_employee package.

-- A full test plan will follow the same pattern but will need to be extended for each of the subprograms to include 
-- additional test cases for 'success' conditions and multiple test cases for different exception or failure conditions.


-- Test Case 1 (Department Records created)
-- Run the following statement in SQL*Plus to view all the Department records.
-- Compare the results with the department values in the specifications document.
SELECT * FROM departments;


-- Test Case 2 (Employee Records created)
-- Run the following statement in SQL*Plus to view all the Employee records.
-- Compare the results with the employee values in the specifications document.
SELECT * FROM employees;


-- Test Case 3a (Create New Employee)
-- Run the following anonymous block in SQL*Plus. 
-- You should get a screen output message displaying the new employee ID created.
